 # About the project (and me)

 ## The project:
<br/>
Everyone knows knows about Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) and how they can turn a regular website into a "desktop app," but the issue with that is, this "Desktop App" still has the annyoing menus and popup permissions of a regular browser tap, and some links will lead you into a new browser windows. What happened to this "desktop app?" Well, Proton Apps happened.
<br/>
Proton App is the short-form of 'Progressive **Electron** App'. These are (obviously) built on Electron, and they give you a more realistic desktop experience. If you're not familliar with how Electron works, there are no popup messages or menus getting in your way, and special links (like logins) will open in a new windows of the app. Most permissions do work, so you can use your favorite websites normally.  It is still a website, but it doesn't seem like it, now does it? I built the app using my good ol' Windows PC, and created an installer for it using Inno Setup Tools.

## Me:
I'm Kwahli Naazim, a 13 year old web and software developer. I've created many programs and software solutions to help anyone who needs it, and I also run Naazim Apps, a small startup company that makes apps and websites.
<br/>
I first had the **idea** for Proton Apps when my Proton Mail desktop free trial expired. I got annoyed that there was a trial on a *free website*, and came back to my previous days of Electron. Got into it, built a Setup, and got this GitHub. Now, here we are.
